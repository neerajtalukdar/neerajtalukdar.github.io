                        <p class="intro-explanation">There are several resources, apps and services which cater to sports fans across the globe. One has to go to Twitter, Reddit, Facebook to stay up to date and engage in news and discussions. There are separate Message Groups that also help bring together fans of a specfic club but these are also isolated.</p>

                            I conducted a quick research session with a couple of friends who are big sports fans to gather inputs on sports consumption behavior <br><br>
                            I did 1 round of evaluation on wireframes and refined them to arrive at the final designs <br><br>

The objective was to get to a point where I could define the scope of the problem much better. On further evaluation, I realized that a good problem to tackle would be to have a single place for sports fans, specifically for ones who support teams or clubs to have a single stop to get information regarding their team of all kinds - stories, news, information about games, upcoming matches, stats about games and palyers etc. </p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text"> 1. There are several apps out there which helps people stay up to date with sports information, and at a high level it can be classified into three different categories<br> 
                                <b>Social media apps </b> the most notable ones being Twitter, Facebook pages, Reddit threads for interacting with other fans<br>
                                <b>Sports specific apps </b> like Cricnews, One Football etc. for live scores and updates <br> 
                                <b>News/Notification based services</b> in general like Google Cards for news and updates <br><br>
                            2. These apps are used for gathering news, following scores and updates, interacting with other fans, sharing joy/frustration, researching on players  <br> <br>
                            3. A lot of information sharing happens over messaging apps as well, sharing of links to twitter and facebook posts, news articles and also direct opinion or info sharing through messages. It was common to find that WhatsApp groups would exists specifically to discuss sports especially catering to a particular team. <br><br>
                            4. While following the game they would actively want to keep track of news about their team - injuries, potential line ups etc. During the game they would want to watch it with their friends and family either live at someone's home for bigger occasions or go to a sports bar to share the experience with other fans. At the same time, they would want to be in close communication with their sports fan groups through messaging apps. They would  go on to social media apps to see what others are talking about after the game is done. <br><br>
