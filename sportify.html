                        <p class="intro-explanation">There are several resources, apps and services which cater to sports fans across the globe. One has to go to Twitter, Reddit, Facebook to stay up to date and engage in news and discussions. There are separate Message Groups that also help bring together fans of a specfic club but these are also isolated.</p>

                            I conducted a quick research session with a couple of friends who are big sports fans to gather inputs on sports consumption behavior <br><br>
                            I did 1 round of evaluation on wireframes and refined them to arrive at the final designs <br><br>

The objective was to get to a point where I could define the scope of the problem much better. On further evaluation, I realized that a good problem to tackle would be to have a single place for sports fans, specifically for ones who support teams or clubs to have a single stop to get information regarding their team of all kinds - stories, news, information about games, upcoming matches, stats about games and palyers etc. </p>

                                <b>Social media apps </b> the most notable ones being Twitter, Facebook pages, Reddit threads for interacting with other fans<br>
                                <b>Sports specific apps </b> like Cricnews, One Football etc. for live scores and updates <br> 
                                <b>News/Notification based services</b> in general like Google Cards for news and updates <br><br>
                            2. These apps are used for gathering news, following scores and updates, interacting with other fans, sharing joy/frustration, researching on players  <br> <br>
                            3. A lot of information sharing happens over messaging apps as well, sharing of links to twitter and facebook posts, news articles and also direct opinion or info sharing through messages. It was common to find that WhatsApp groups would exists specifically to discuss sports especially catering to a particular team. <br><br>
                            4. While following the game they would actively want to keep track of news about their team - injuries, potential line ups etc. During the game they would want to watch it with their friends and family either live at someone's home for bigger occasions or go to a sports bar to share the experience with other fans. At the same time, they would want to be in close communication with their sports fan groups through messaging apps. They would  go on to social media apps to see what others are talking about after the game is done. <br><br>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text">After defining the positioning of the suggestions, we focused on defining the nuanced details around these suggestions. Design decisions were taken based on the guiding principles that have been enlisted above as well and also taking into consideration the possibility of bringing in some of the ideas captured in the idea map above. <b>We wanted to keep the cards for suggestions uniform such that the name of the document/article would be at the top and act as the link and have card height uniform for all suggestions. </b> We also wanted to keep the suggestion non-intrusive thus more relevant tabs like Customer Information and Contact History were prioritized over Agent Assist. But to convey that suggestions were ready for usage, we had a notification badge appearing next to the icon.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text"> We developed an initial version for early field trials with a couple of customers who were excited to test it out. Based on the feedback we incorporated a few changes before going GA. 
                            
                          
                           In essence, we identified the following major feedback points: <br><br>
                                1. Truncation of the document name by limiting it to the top line(and dedicating the remainder of the area to the feedback icons) was not ideal as the latter half of some of the document/webpage names would be the unique identifier and help in decision making.<br>
                                2. The reason for a particular suggestion being proposed was not very clear. <br>
                                3. The confidence score number was not that meaningful. Agents were mostly interested in the top 1-2 suggestions. <br>
                                4. Sometimes, the snippet itself would be enough to get to the answer. Limiting the line length to 2-3 lines would require them to go the link which was frustrating.<br>
                                5. Feedback would not be provided immediately as a habit. It would be more ideal to do that during the wrap-up state.<br>
                                6. There was some confusion around the word search as a tab. Some agents thought that it was a search on the suggestions itself. <br>
                                
                              </p> 
                            <p class="call-out-quote"> 
                            "I would rather have the relevant answer shown right there, than having to go to the link again and search for it using those keywords and it seems like the answer is right there... so it is a bit frustrating." 
                            
                            </p>

                         <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text"> Based on the feedback, we decided to make a few key changes:<br><br>
                                1. We removed the icons for upvote/downvote to the bottom section to allow for more screen-estate for the name.<br>
                                2. The dedicated footer area now also displayed some top key-phrases that were parsed by the AI engine. <br>
                                3. We had a call-out for only the top most suggestion. For the remainder, it was anyways stack ranked. <br>
                                4. The card height was expanded to have 6 lines of text from 2. We identified that showing more information upfront for each card was more important than showing more suggestions in a singke view for which they can scroll anyways and the chanes of someone going to the lower ranked suggestions is rare. We also gave the flexibility to expand the card and display more text if required for ones where the recommendation snippet is larger.<br>
                                5. We displayed the suggestions in the wrap-up phase and asked for optional feedback. If upvoted, it was by default captured as part of the notes summary.<br>
                                6. We changed the name of the 2nd tab to Knowedge Base to make it more explicit.
                               
                             
                         <br><br>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text"> Our two customers were significantly convinced by the usefulness of the agent assist feature and decided to purchase the license. The announcement of GA for this feature was met with a lot of excitement in the field and we had more than 50% of our customers signed up for a 30 day trial phase. More than 90% of them eventually subscribed for it. Customers reported a drop of approx 18% in handle time on an average over a sustained use of 3 months. Also as part of the solution (after the feature went live), we experimented in providing a simple topic modeling visualization for an admin/supervisor use-case to a select set of customers which helped them in identifying popular themes of conversations and help in better distribution of agents across teams and also in improving their own knowledge bases. We later added this dashboard in our Reporting module. </p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text"> This project was very unique in the sense that we had to engage with stakeholders outside Cisco - Google's Engineers and Product Managers on a weekly basis initially. It was my first exploration in the domain of AI based experiences in an industry setting. I learnt some essential ideas around recommender based systems in general. I also learnt a lot from existing literature on AI based UX. This helped in defining some design principles and it was enlightening to use those principles in practise and get feedback from customers and improve on the design based on quick feedback from the early trials.</p>
