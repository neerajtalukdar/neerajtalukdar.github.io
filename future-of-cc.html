Current competitors were doing better in the cloud market with better leverage of emerging technologies. The ask for the UX team was to do some blue-sky thinking and come up with an end-to end. </p>

                                Although there are several personas in the contact center ecosystem, for simplicity, we identified the 3 main personas that would help drive the visioning and brainstorming exercise.

Each one of us came up with as many ideas possible for eeach of the 3 personas and wrote it down in sticky notes.<br><br>

                                Next, we all took turns to sahre our ideas with the team and stick our ideas on the whiteboard. If there were similar ideas we started a clustering process to identify over-arching themes and patterns<br><br>

                                We analyzed the ideas against a impact-feasibility matrix to identify some key ideas that we thought would be relevant to implement in our solution for a competitive edge.<br><br>

                                We finally took the key ideas that we narrowed down upon and stitched it together in acoherent end-to-end journey which eventually transformed into the narrative.<br>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text"> The narrative became a great rallying artifact around which a lot of important decisions were taken with regards to the product direction. High level executives were keen on implementing at least a couple of the ideas that were thought through. Two key projects which emerged from this efforts are the Desktop Re-design and Flow Control work, both of which have been documented separately. The keynote became a reference point for a lot of design and product decisions and still acts as the Nort Star we all want to head towards!</p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text"> This was a wonderful thought exercise to get the entire team do some unconstrained blue sky-thinking which helped us come up with a lot of novel ideas. In everyday work settings we are often stuck with some fundamental assumptions because of persistently working on a particular product. This exercise actes as a much needed refresh button. It was also imperative to eventually define solutions which are feasible in some capacity and thus some level of grounding was required once the ideation phase was completed. The double-diamond approach helped us in scoping down our ideas. The entire act of connecting all the dots and putting together a coherent story was tough but exhilarating! Last but not the last, it was a great team building exercise as designers from different parts of the world worked seamlessly in a 1 week sprint to come up with several ideas and an overall storyline which we all worked together remotely over the next few weeks. This remains one of my favorite projects of all time. </p>
