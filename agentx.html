                        <p class="intro-explanation">Agents in Contact Centers deal with lots of customer queries of various kinds. Often times, they have to reference articles, documents and FAQs to resolve these issues. A lot of time is spent on actually searching for the relevant answer. Since most contact centers are technically "Cost Centers", it becomes critical to save time, and help agents in this process of answer retrieval.</p>

From the simplest to the most complicated product or service that you can think of, there is almost surely a customer support team set up to take care of your needs and answer your questions. The project I worked on was focused on the cloud offering for the persona of customer support agents. It primarily consisted of two major efforts: 

<br /> <br /> 1. Field visits conducted with 5 of our customers to understand their current experience and pain-points and also understand nuances around contact center in general. <br /> <br /> 2. Re-designing the agent desktop experience based on the learnings, studying trends of existing comptetitors and also aligning with the overall design system alignment across the Collaboration Technology Group in Cisco. </p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text">- There is no one size fits all desktop. Customers want flexibility in defining their own experience. This becomes critical 
   for customers who want to migrate from on-prem to cloud, as they have the ability to build and manage their own
   gadgets on-prem. Thus, there needs to be a way to have flexibility in building out the agent desktop in terms of 
                                integrations, widgets, layout they would want for their organization. <br /> <br /> 

- There is no on-boarding experience at all. Agents have to undergo extensive training to get onboarded to the UI. Also
   this requires them to undergo everytime there is a feature update. <br /> <br /> 

- Agents often use the agent desktop in conjunction with several other applications, websites, CRM systems etc. There is  steep learning curve involved with this framework and agents get used to the multi-tab multi-window approach over a period of time. A pattern of usage observed was minimizing the view. <br /> <br /> 

- A lot of the everyday interactions require agents to perform menial, monotonous tasks like searching for knowledge base
   articles and responses which takes up a lot of the agents' time. <br /> <br /> 

- Overall experience is broken as agents use a bunch of different tool and applications to get to the relevant information
   about the customer and identifying the best possible way to resolve their query/issue. <br /> <br /> 

- There is no proper way for agents to track their performance over time and get an undersatnding of how they are faring
   as compared to others, ways in which they can improve.</p>

                            <p>We identified 4 main efforts coming out of this research study:
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            1. Fixing short-term issues and gaps with the current agent desktop solution. The objective was to address some of the low-hanging fruits and also make strategic moves in the direction of new agent desktop experience being worked upon in the background. Also aligning the overall experience with that of the rest of Webex portfolio. One strategic move in that direction was to change the look and feel to align with the Momentum Design system. This was primarily supported by Mocha, the visual designer in the project, with myself providing guidance from an overall experience perspective ensuring that all the scenarios were being covered. <br/><br/>
                                2. The re-imagination and conceptualization of a new agent desktop experience. This was based on the research findings, competitor analysis and also with the business objective of migration of an enormous customer base from the on-prem solution to the cloud solution. <a href="password/password.html">View details of the project here</a><br/><br/>
3. An agent desktop layout builder experience to support partner customizations and integrations. This was mostly driven by Karen Song, an intern in our team. She led a few webex calls with partners and customers and started off with some initial explorations. I acted as a mentor for this sub-project in the initial phases and took over from her once she completed her internship. <a href="password/password.html">View details of the project here</a> <br/><br/>
4. Defining a supervisor desktop experience - who act as super agents and help manage teams, queues, analyze performance and provide guidance and coaching to agents. In the solution we inheritted, we did not have a consolidated experience as such.    <a href="password/password.html">View details of the project here</a>
