                            <p class="animated fadeInRight">1.  Although a lot of information is shared on FB, not everyone has access to FB
2. Incoming students have a lot of anxiety regarding different kinds of things such as courses, jobs, life in a new city etc. for which they reach out to current students/ alumni.
3. The information shared by the current students is extremely valuable to incoming students.
4. Course registration was one of the most common pain points. We analysed the issue based on the interviews. It seemed like people where overwhelmed by looking at all kinds of courses on SIO and not being sure what to pick up.
5. Courses decide what you get out of the program and what career path you can take. CMU SIO has brief description of each course but students find it difficult to figure out how particular course could help them in achieving their career goals/ matching their interests
6. People get a important info during Open House Sessions because of one-on-one communication but not everybody can attend the open house sessions, esp. international students.
7. Although FB serves as a platform where incoming students can ask questions, not everyone feels comfortable to ask questions on an online forum</p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight">We generated 4 storyboards and speed dated with a few participants. The ideas varied from an anonymous question answering platform to a platform for more informative course registration to one which sets up students with mentors to automated course selection. We tried to play around with the level of automation and human involvement in our ideas to see the reactions from people.

                            <p>
                            1. Leaving something as important as course selection (which would play a big role in deciding career paths) to a machine might not be the best idea after all!.
2. Human element is really important. Having anonymous interactions would create a sense of disconnect amongst the students. 
3. We realized that having incoming students connect with current students/alumni creates a wonderful opportunity where they can create valuable networks for a lifetime. 
4. The participants agreed with the idea that the feeling of connection would be stronger and the students would be more likely to respond to students who have a lot in common in terms of educational background, interests, career goals etc. as they themselves would have gone through a similar state of dilemma. 
5. Students would be likely to pass on valuable advice to the incoming students as they themselves were helped in a similar way when they were about to join through the same service and it is one's conscience which would motivate one to contribute and help out. 
6. Participants liked the idea of having a mentor assigned to the students having similar interest/background, who could guide them and provide valuable advice for the journey ahead.</p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight">I conducted user testing with 3 users on the Hi-Fi InVision prototype to get feedback and identify usability issues.

Here are some of the key learnings from the user testing session

1. The sudden jump to the home screen after confirmation of the mentor was sudden and confusing. As a result, one user thought that all the subsequent questions/answers would be relevant to his mentor only.
2. The different tags for the courses were helpful in describing the courses.
3. The "Add More" interaction was much more intuitive than the previous one.
4.  The description of why the interests and mentors were matched helped in understanding how the action was taken and improving "trust".
5. The Bookmarking feature should be available in the summarized view of the answers as well and not only the detailed view.</p>
