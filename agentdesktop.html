								<h5 class="font-alt m-t-0">What is this Project About?</h5>
								<p>This project is focused on re-defining the experience for contact center agents. To provide some background, Cisco inheritted a agent desktop solution from the acquistion of Broadsoft as part of it's portfolio. The objective was to assess current pain-points with the product and enhance the overall user experience. We conducted research across 5 different contact centers to understand the issues with the current product and identify ways in which we could improve upon the experience. This effort spawned 4 different projects that I led. Here is a glimpse into each of those projects. 
                                
                                </p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 m-b-30">
								<h5 class="font-alt m-t-0">What was my contribution?</h5>
								<p>I defined the research script and protocol for the user research sessions. I led half the interview sessions conducted with the agents while the other half was led by my colleague Arindam. I was responsible for collating information across all interviews and extracting insights which was used in making the design decisions. I was  responsible for proposing short-term and long-term design solutions based on the research, analyzing market trends and leveraging the new Momentum design system for making changes to the existing solution. As described, for each of the 4 different projects, I played different roles: I acted as the primary designer for the desktop re-design effort and the Supervisor Desktop effort. For the Agent Desktop Layout Builder effort, I was acting as a mentor in the first half and later took over as the primary. For the visual design, I was acting as a reviewer on the project. </p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight">Contact Centers support almost every single product or service that we use on an everyday basis. From the simplest to the most complicated product or service that you can think of, there is almost surely a customer support team set up to take care of your needs and answer your questions. The project I worked on was focused on the cloud offering for the persona of customer support agents. It primarily consisted of two major efforts: 

<br /> <br /> 1. Field visits conducted with 5 of our customers to understand their current experience and pain-points and also understand nuances around contact center in general. <br /> <br /> 2. Re-designing the agent desktop experience based on the learnings, studying trends of existing comptetitors and also aligning with the overall design system alignment across the Collaboration Technology Group in Cisco. </p>

                            <p>We identified 4 main efforts coming out of this research study:
                                
                            </p>

                            1. Fixing short-term issues and gaps with the current agent desktop solution. The objective was to address some of the low-hanging fruits and also make strategic moves in the direction of new agent desktop experience being worked upon in the background. Also aligning the overall experience with that of the rest of Webex portfolio. One strategic move in that direction was to change the look and feel to align with the Momentum Design system. This was primarily supported by Mocha, the visual designer in the project, with myself providing guidance from an overall experience perspective ensuring that all the scenarios were being covered. <br/><br/>
                               
                            
                            
                            2. The re-imagination and conceptualization of a new agent desktop experience. This was based on the research findings, competitor analysis and also with the business objective of migration of an enormous customer base from the on-prem solution to the cloud solution. <a href="password/password.html">View details of the project here</a>

3. An agent desktop layout builder experience to support partner customizations and integrations. This was mostly driven by Karen Song, an intern in our team. She led a few webex calls with partners and customers and started off with some initial explorations. I acted as a mentor for this sub-project in the initial phases and took over from her once she completed her internship.

4. Defining a supervisor desktop experience - who act as super agents and help manage teams, queues, analyze performance and provide guidance and coaching to agents. In the solution we inheritted, we did not have a consolidated experience as such.    <a href="password/password.html">View details of the project here</a>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight"> I learnt a great deal of things from thsi mammoth project. Detailed learnings are captured in each of the individual sections. However, at a high level, this project helped develop leadership skills as I was responsible for leading a 3 member design team and collaborated with product managers, engineering managers and developers across multiple time-zones. This was a unique experience to conduct research at contact centers and travel with other product managers and deisgners in the team. We had a great time in engaging the product managers in user-centered research techniques. Assessment of the accumulated iformation with the team now dispersed across two different time-zones was also a challenge which we tried to overcome through online collaboration using Miro. </p>
