                                Contact Centers support almost every single product or service that we use on an everyday basis. From the simplest to the most complicated product or service that you can think of, there is almost surely a customer support team set up to take care of your needs and answer your questions. These agents generally handle several customer support issues on a daily basis over calls, chat or emails. Everyone single one of us has most likely encountered an interaction with an agent.</p>

                                Cisco acquired Broadsoft in early 2018. This resulted in inheritence of a cloud based Contact Center solution. We already had a strong foothold in the on-prem market so the solution helped in complementing our overall solution. As part of the suite of products, we also got the Agent Desktop interface. Agent Desktop is the cream of any contact center solution. This is the interface that the agent uses to manage chat, email and voice interactions. Although there are other aspects like Admin interface, script builder, report designer, Agent Desktop is the primary tool cause it is used by all the agents for any contact center, which are much larger in number as compared to a few admins or supervisors. The objective was to get feedback on the existing experience and improve upon to make it <b>the best-in-class agent desktop solution</b> out there in the market. The other goal was to eventually <b>migrate our customers from on-prem to cloud</b> and ensuring a seamless transition.</p>

                                The project I worked on was focused on the cloud offering for the persona of customer support agents. It primarily consisted of two major efforts: 

<br> <br> 1. Field visits conducted with 6 of our customers in the US to understand their current experience and pain-points and also understand nuances around contact center in general. <br> <br> 2. Analyzing the data from the field visit and re-designing the agent desktop experience based on the learnings, studying trends of existing comptetitors and also aligning with the overall design system alignment across the Collaboration Technology Group in Cisco. This evolved into 3 major design initatives. </p>

                                i. Fixing short-term issues and gaps with the current agent desktop solution. The objective was to address some of the low-hanging fruits and also make strategic moves in the direction of new agent desktop experience being worked upon in the background. Also aligning the overall experience with that of the rest of Webex portfolio. One strategic move in that direction was to change the look and feel to align with the Momentum Design system. This was primarily supported by Mocha, the visual designer in the project, with myself providing guidance from an overall experience perspective ensuring that all the scenarios were being covered. Here is a link to a press release that happened around this effort.</p>

                               iii. An agent desktop layout builder experience to support partner customizations and integrations. One major business objective was to bring in some of the flexibilities that was already available in our on-prem products. This was mostly driven by one of the interns in our team. She led a webex calls with partners and customers and started off with some initial explorations. I acted as a mentor for this initiative over the course of the project. This work is currently at it's nascent stages.

The objective was to understand current painpoints with the solution and also observe them in the contact center settings. My primary focus was on the Agent persona.

After tagging interesting quotes from the interview, we did affinity mapping to identify the overarching categories and themes. These categories were used in subsequent steps for the ideation phase. This was done in collaboration of the PMs to help them stay involved in the end-to-end process. This helped in generating an overall picture of a day in the life of an agent, supervisor and admin.

                                    We narrowed down our ideas from the brainstorming session and broke them down into a phased approach. This was required to plan out the roadmap of the product. This exercise was enriching and enlightening from a UX standpoint as I worked closely with the PM to help come up with the overall breakdown of the planned features across multiple phases. We used an impact feasibility matrix to help with this breakdown apart from the data we had already gathered form our field reserach.

                                    The layout and IA was one of the most critical sections of this effort. We came up with a lot of iterations and options to arrive at an optimal solution. This work helped the UI architect plan out the development work much in advance.

                                    We started with creating wireframes and focusing on individual components within Agent Desktop. This component based approach also helped the Development team with their work as they were planning to use Web Components as part of the overhaul in the UI Architecture.

This has been a highly iterative process with feedback received and worked upon over multiple rounds starting from a product leadership level down to Engineering level support durring implementation.

                                <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text"> I learnt a lot from this mammoth project. At a high level, this project helped develop leadership skills as I was responsible for leading a  3 member design team and collaborated with product managers, engineering managers and developers across multiple time-zones. This was a unique experience to conduct research at contact centers and travel with other product managers and deisgners in the team. We had a great time in engaging the product managers in user-centered research techniques. Assessment of the accumulated information with the team now dispersed across two different time-zones was also a challenge which we tried to overcome through online collaboration. Analyzing the research inputs and working with the product manager to define the product roadmap was a first time experience for me and helped evolve my product strategy skills.</p>
