It offers viewers a chance to raise awareness of this important issue on social media, which is the medium through which interactions with the installation take place, using the hash tag #flighttofreedom. </p>

                        <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text">According to the Refugee Council, statistics say there are around 60 million people who have been forcibly displaced from their homeland. If all these people were combined into a single nation, it would be the 24th largest country in the world.
In countries like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia, millions of families have been forced to flee their homes due to persecution, conflict and poverty. These refugees, many of whom are children (some with parents and some without), are received with open arms in some countries and a closed door in others. They are too often caught in the middle of political negotiations and remain in a sort of stateless and homeless limbo. Not only this, threats like abuse and exploitation await women and undocumented individuals, even as they find homes in new places. We wanted to depict this entanglement refugees face as they leave behind homes and take flight to an unknown future.</p>

This picture became the symbol of the tragedy of refugees. This coincided with our effort at coming up with a proposal for our final project in the coursework. We wanted to create an installation that would create awareness around the refugee crisis and realized that Twitter would be a great platform to leverage. We each came up with some ideas and the idea of using doves/white birds trying to fly but yet constrained by wires was a powerful representation.</p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text">The final idea is an installation of white birds that arranged in a sequence similar to formations in which birds fly in a flock. The idea was to generate movement in the birds in the form of flapping of wings when someone tweets about the ongoing refugee crisis. The more you tweet using that specific hashtag #FlightToFreedom, the more the intensity of the flight of ythe birds increase, with at some point trying to break the shackles and take flight.</p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text">The target audience for this sculpture is not specific, but includes anyone who could be willing to open their hearts to the refugee crisis. Set along a pathway in front of an apartment building on Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh, the sculpture is nestled into its residential environment and offers subtle passive interactions to the residents of the building as they enter or exit their homes, and to people walking on the sidewalk along 5th Ave. The gentle flapping of bird wings as well as the sign along the pathway we hope will invite passersby into a more intimate interaction with our installation. 

The location of the installation, although set in a semi-private area, is easily accessible from the sidewalk. A combination of plaques installed near the adjacent bus stop and near the installation serves to inform people about purpose of the sculpture and its interactions.</p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text">The sculpture, designed to reside in an urban locale of Pittsburgh, tries to engage the passersby and residents of the area to communicate awareness about the on-going refugee crisis. Gentle wing flapping movement of the birds passively invites the passersby. The plight of refugees as they struggle to move towards a better future is depicted in this slow flapping motion of birds as if they are struggling to take flight.

                            A plaque displays the intent of the sculpture and guides the viewers to engage actively by sending a tweet message to the refugees. Viewers can tweet their message of encouragement for the refugees and include the provided tag #flighttoreedom. Such active engagement is rewarded by increased momentum and speed of wing movement. Also, the person receives a random story about refugee survival, as a gratitude for their encouragement and empathy. </p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text">We used DC motors and a pulley system to control the motion of the birds. Each column of birds had a pulley at both ends, with a loop of fishing line going around them and attached to the body of the birds. There were 6 rows of fishing lines going through the wings of the birds, 2 on either side for each of the 3 rows to keep them constrained. Thus, with the clockwise and anti-clockwise motion of the motors connected to the pulley system, the bodies of the birds were pulled up and down while the wings pivoted at their midpoints, resulting in the desired flapping motion. </p>

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text">To reverse the direction of the DC motors, we needed to be able to reverse the direction of the current in the motor. We used a H-bridge circuit for this purpose. Here is the reference <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/dc-motor-control-using-an-h-bridge/">link</a>.

                            <p class="animated fadeInRight description-text">This was a novel opportunity for me as a designer to explore the space of reactive installations. We spent a lot of time iterating on the physical prototypes of the birds using laser cutting. We also spent a lot of time in exploring animation sequences of the birds in motion. Setting up the entire framework at a smaller scale inside lab settings is significantly different from setting up the actual installation outside, especially with uncontrollable circumstances such as weather. We had to attempt to set up the installation twice cause we struggled a lot in setting up the pulley system and the circuitry in freezing Pittsburgh temperatures. Overall, it was a great exposure to building out a complex motion system powered by Arduino.</p>
