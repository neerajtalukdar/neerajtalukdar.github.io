                        <p class="intro-explanation">This project is focused on creating a GUI based tool for building contact center based processes like routing pathways that the customer experiences. The current scripting tool we have is lacking in a lot of aspects. Since this is one of the most critical functionalities of any contact center and with the current paradigm requiring a lot of handholding from professional services teams in helping customers build out custom scripts for meeting their requirements, it was mission critical for us to drastcially improve our current scripting experience.</p>

                        <p class="intro-explanation">We identified key gaps in the existing experience by speaking with existing users of the tool. We evaluated existing solutions out there in the market to set a competitive benchmark and defined a high-level experience before we started off with detailed designs for individual features. The new tool, called Flow Designer is a significant enhancement on the existing experience and aims to be a critical piece in our suite of products to achieve the vision of a programmatic contact center. </p>

                            For any Contact Center, one of the most critical tools required to ensure smooth functioning of the organization is the routing logic builder which the administrator or developer will use to define the customer's experience and the flow logic that will result in the best possible experience for the customers. For eg. Sending the customerrs to the appropriate team of agents which could besst handle their request. A typical example that everyone faces is the IVR experience which asks us to select a number from thee dialpad to route us to an agent.

                           Flow Designer is a visual scripting tool that allows users to build any type of automated experience forr Contact Center use-cases. Think of it as the pre-frontal cortex of the contact center’s brain. It enables robotic process automation by receiving events, making a determination of what to do next, and orchestrating it. We needed to build out a new tool to replace the existing scripting tool, which was lacking in several aspects and required a lot of support from our Professional Services team to enable building flows and scripts which should otherwise be possible.

                                We primarily had two strategic goals. The current approach for setting up routing strategies was super complicated and split up into types- Entry Point Routing Strategies and Queue Routing Strategies. We wanted to simplify that model to facilitate an easy mechanism of creating routing strategies through a single end-to-end unified flow. The othe goal was to have Flow Designer as the single go to tool for enabling the creation of any kind of logic driven flows based on events. This would lead to the grander vision of achieveing the status of a <b>truly programmatic contact center. </b></p>

                                    We looked at some competitor products in this space, viz.

                                    There were three primary objectives: <br><br>
1. Identification of critical use cases to pursue after we achieve feature parity. <br>
2. Collection of custom flows commonly being requested from Professional Services. <br>
3. Identification of pain-points of existing users (e.g. not being able to copy flows, share flows across customers, normalize flow experience across channels, etc.)

                                   We first focused on getting the skeleton framework right. Once that was decided upon after several layouts, we started building on top of it to create an initial set of wireframes and concepts which we worked very closely withe Product Manager and the Architect to set the groundwork. Paralelly, we also worked with the Product Manager to help come up with an initial roadmap of the product for the next 3 quarters. This helped us in prioritizaing our deetailed design efforts.

Then the two of us (IxD) split up the work to own individual feature sets while working with the visual designer to incrementally build out the feature seets over the next few quarters.

                                  Once some of the key features were built out, we set up a usability testing session with 5 users spanning across different levels of experience and background to test out whatever had been implemented so far. This was an interesting experience as some of the features were still being vuilt out and we needed to add disclaimers at the beginning of the session to call this out. Although some of the issues encountered by the users during the session were obvious ones as a result of something we knew was broken and needed to be fixeed or was in porgress work, we definitely received quite a lot of useful feedback which we could start workring on immediately and this helped us get ahead and saved time as the date for GA was fast approaching. Designw ork on these enhancements are currently in progress.
